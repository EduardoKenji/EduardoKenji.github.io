* [A perceptron learns to separate two distinct sets of data in Java + LibGDX framework](https://github.com/EduardoKenji/perceptron-linear-solver)
* [Currently, a simple snake game in Python](https://github.com/EduardoKenji/snake-game)
* [My own implementation of a multilayer perceptron to classify processed handwritten letters (S, X and Z) in Python](https://github.com/EduardoKenji/multilayer-perceptron)

My old/archived projects:

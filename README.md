This portfolio comprises stand-alone projects I have created or have worked on to study software engineering, data analysis, machine learning algorithms and game development.

My current projects: 

* [Q-learning application to solve mazes in Python](https://github.com/EduardoKenji/q-learning-maze-solver)
* [A perceptron learns to separate two distinct sets of data in Java + LibGDX framework](https://github.com/EduardoKenji/perceptron-linear-solver)
* [Currently, a simple snake game in Python](https://github.com/EduardoKenji/snake-game)
* [My new and faster implementation of a Multilayer Perceptron in Python with NumPy arrays](https://github.com/EduardoKenji/multilayer-perceptron-numpy-array)


My old/archived projects:

* [My old implementation of a Multilayer Perceptron to classify processed handwritten letters (S, X and Z) in Python](https://github.com/EduardoKenji/multilayer-perceptron)
* [A traffic simulator in Java](https://github.com/EduardoKenji/traffic-simulator)
